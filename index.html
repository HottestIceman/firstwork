    I want to become an AI developer so this is my start, I used to be a stupid guy<br />
    who only knew about drinking and waisting time then i realized what i really want to do <br />
    what i like to do with this life that i have got and that is i want to create i to produce <br />
    cool stuff so that is what makes me happy i know i am too late to realise this in my life, but <br />
    i feel their is still time for me to learn, adapt and move forward with this career option in my life.
